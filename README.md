# Description
This project was assinged for me by introcept.co

## Task
Things to do

    Create a form to get
        Name
        Gender
        Phone
        Email
        Address
        Nationality
        Date of birth
        Education background
        Preferred mode of contact (select one from email, phone, none)
    You can be creative with the fields.
    Add relevant validation to the form both frontend (js) and backend (php)
    After form submission, if fields are valid save to a csv file
    Show all clients pulled in from the CSV as another page
